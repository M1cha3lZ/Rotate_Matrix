# Rotate_Matrix
Given a directory of a file that contains a int matrix in the following format:

The first line indicates the no. of rows in a 2D matrix. It must be an integer [1-9].

The second line indicates the no. of columns in a 2D matrix. It must be an integer [1-9].

The following lines represent the integers in the matrix. Each element in the matrix must be an integer [0-9].

Each line represents a row in the matrix.

The program will read in the matrix and perform operations in order to write a rotated version of the matrix into the same file.
